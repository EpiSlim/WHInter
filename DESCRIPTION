Description: WHInter is a working set algorithm to solve large L1-regularised problems with two-way interactions for binary design matrices. It avoids exhaustive scanning of all interactions by devoloping a new bound to test if a feature is involved in any interaction. The computations are further accelerated by using derivates of the maximum inner product search problem.
